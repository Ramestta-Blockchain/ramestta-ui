Each contact with the blockchain necessitates a tiny transaction cost to reimburse the Ethereum operators â€“ this is the Gas Fee. When the Ethereum blockchain becomes overburdened, the transaction fee rises in accordance with supply and demand.',

        text2:"Ethereum is a decentralized, expansive blockchain that allows smart contracts. Ether is the platform's cryptocurrency.",
        text3:"Decentralized applications or Dapps are programs that facilitate interaction without the use of foreign entities. Connections that rely on third parties to accomplish the activity include financial transactions and legal discussions. In this aspect, dApps are advantageous since they implement contracts and agreements using solid code and a layer of computers, rather than depending on the expertise and integrity of 3rd parties.",
        text4:"To put it another way, decentralized applications are more advanced versions of traditional apps that provide you with complete control over your transactions. They allow you to interact with a peer without fear of being judged or having Big Brother watching you at all times. These programs, too, do not require any personal data to operate."
